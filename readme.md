# Overview

### Front End

The front end of the portfolio was made entirely with plain JavaScript code using ECMAScript 2015+ features without any frameworks like Angular, React or Vue. It's using libraries such as [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) and [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). To generate our static files that will be uploaded to the environment, we're using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

### Back End

The site is hosted using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) by Google. It's a static generated site, so it has no back-end. Currently, [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) views are populated using data from home.json local file.

## Installation

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your machine, these are our only dependencies to run the project locally.

```
npm install
npm start
```
